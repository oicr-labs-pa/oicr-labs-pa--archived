Prior to joining the Awadalla laboratory in May 2016, I completed my Hon. B.Sc. in Global Health and Genome Biology at Trinity College, University of Toronto. My previous research activities include working as part of the International Centre for Disability and Rehabilitation Cameroon team, and looking at the reach of vital registration systems in South Africa. Recently I have become interested in looking at the various factors impacting health behaviour and practices in different contexts and how health outcomes can be improved through early diagnosis. Through working at the Awadalla laboratory, I hope to study disease markers at a molecular level in order to identify patterns of association, which could stand to increase the accuracy of early diagnostic testing and have a large scale public health impact.
