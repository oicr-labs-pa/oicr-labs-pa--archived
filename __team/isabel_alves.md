  My research interests lie in understanding the role of evolutionary forces such as demography and recombination in shaping genomic patterns of diversity across the human genome. During my PhD, at the University of Bern, Switzerland, I investigated the demographic history of modern human populations by using a model-based approach, which allowed me to provide new insights on the process of colonisation of modern humans across the world and their interactions with archaic populations. By joining the Awadalla lab, I aim at applying my knowledge on human population genetics to better understand the impact of diversity heterogeneity across genomes on individual/population disease susceptibility.
