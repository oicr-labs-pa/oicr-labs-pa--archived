Prior to joining the Awadalla Lab in august 2010, I worked over 8 years at Genizon Biosciences Inc, a biotechnology company. During this time, as bioinformatician and manager I was responsible for providing support in key areas of the gene discovery process such as genetic marker selection, genotyping primer design, gene data mining, genomic sequence annotation, sequence analysis and patent preparation.
At the Awadalla Lab I oversee all bioinformatics projects and participate in the development of tools to analyze and manage the next-generation sequencing data. Through a close working relationship with post-doc and students from the Lab, the bioinformatics team is in charge of selecting, integrating, developping, and applying appropriate bioinformatics tools to support all the laboratory researches.
