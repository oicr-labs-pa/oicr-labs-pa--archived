about_txt: |
  Prior to joining the Awadalla lab in November 2016, I graduated from the PhD program in the Department of Biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. I am also an alumni of the CIHR Strategic Training in Advanced Genetic Epidemiology (STAGE) program at the University of Toronto, and was a member of the Strug lab at SickKids in Toronto, working on the discovery and understanding of genetic modifiers of various comorbidities of Cystic Fibrosis. My research interests are currently focused on developing statistical methods for genetics research including variant detection in the presence of genetic interaction, rare variant effects, and improvement and evaluation of disease risk prediction models incorporating genetic factors.
