Prior to joining the Awadalla Lab as a PhD student in January 2018, I completed my BSc in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London. As an aspiring bioinformatician and geneticist, I am particularly interested in integrating genomic and epigenomic profiles to improve personalized medicine in cancer patients. As part of my PhD research, I am investigating the use of cell-free DNA from liquid biopsies to identify genetic and epigenetic markers indicative of cancer development. I am also trying to understand how the genetic and epigenetic landscape evolves from a pre-cancerous to cancerous state through cell-free DNA.
