  I am broadly interested in uncovering the evolutionary processes and environmental factors underlying gene expression changes and regulation differences within and between populations. I joined the group of Philip Awadalla in November 2013 after a PhD in evolutionary developmental biology at McGill University. I recently became interested in human populations, which offer tremendous power to study the genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypes and diseases. Particularly, the CARTaGENE cohort provides a unique framework to test hypotheses about how demographic events can shape spatial genetic variation, gene expression, endophenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. In addition, this cohort has been well characterized for several environmental factors, and therefore, offers the possibility to discover how these interact with one’s individual genetic background to affect gene expression and disease susceptibility. I am also exploring the dynamic interactions between viruses and the host immune system in the CARTaGENE cohort. In the last few years, it has become clear that our virome and microbiome can affect physiological processes, inflammation status, and more generally, can modulate our susceptibility to complex diseases. I am also involved in other projects exploring the population genetic processes underlying the evolution of genetic variants contributing to various neurological disorders.
