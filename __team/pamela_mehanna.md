After obtaining a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics from the University of Montreal, I completed my education with a master's degree in the same field at the CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal. During these studies, using next-generation sequencing data, I conducted a project aiming to characterize new small circular extra-chromosomal DNA fragments called microDNAs and their modulation by anti-cancer treatments. I also participated in the development of SNooPer, a machine learning-based method for somatic variant identification from low-pass next-generation sequencing. My research interests include population genetics, cancer genomics and pharmacogenomics. I joined Dr. Awadalla's team in July 2017 as a bioinformatician. My main tasks are bioinformatics support to grad students as well as participating in the analysis of sequencing and genotyping data.
