  My research interests are in next-generation sequencing technologies and pipelines and in better understanding genetic diseases such as cancer. I have a BSc in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology from the University of Calgary and an MBinf (Bioinformatics) from the University of Guelph. After completing a research rotation with the Awadalla lab in the fall of 2015, I joined in January 2016 to begin studying alignment of cancer genomes to the human reference genome. I am co-supervised with OICRâ€™s Dr. Jared Simpson.
