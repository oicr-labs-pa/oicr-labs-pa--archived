I was Initially trained as a molecular biologist and population geneticist studying the patterns of genetic diversity of West-African populations as well as that of pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum and Papillomavirus that impinge upon the health of these populations. I joined the Awadalla lab after completion of an MSc in Molecular Biology at the University of Montreal where I conducted a research project involving extensive field work in West Africa to document genetic diversity within the region. Since joining the Awadalla group, I have been involved in designing and executing genetic and genomic experiments for various research projects in the lab and currently I am in charge of several human genetics experiments using second-generation sequencing approaches.
