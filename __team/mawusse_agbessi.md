After my M. Sc in Bioinformatics obtained in 2013 at the University of Montpellier (FRANCE), I worked for a year within the Palm tree's development biology Lab in CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development). The aim of the project I worked on was to design a molecular detection kit allowing the early detection of mantled somaclonal variation in Oil palm tree ( Elaesis guineensis) through the exploration of genes families affected by the mantled abnormality. Hence, I was in charge to analyse the E. guineensis inflorescence and cellular suspension transcriptomes data, in order to identify potential genes controlling changes in the somatic embryogenesis in these cultivar.
I joined the Awadalla Lab in November 2014 as a Bioinformatics Research Assistant. My position allows me to work as a bioinformatics support but also provide me the opportunity to reach new objectives in data analysis.
