  I completed my BSc in forensic science at Trent University in April 2015. During my undergrad I had the opportunity to do research at NRDPFC (Natural Resources DNA Profiling & Forensic Centre) where I helped develop an assay to determine the susceptibility of goats to scrapie. In September 2015 I joined the department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto and I am now working towards completing my MSc in the Awadalla lab. My research interests include identifying disease-linked variants that can be used for the development of personalized medicine and genetic diagnostic testing.
