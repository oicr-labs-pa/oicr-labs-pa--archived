  I am interested in understanding how epigenomic processes control the information encoded in the genomes of an organism, in an evolutionary, developmental and disease context.
  I aim, by joining the Awadalla Lab in 2015, to develop a comprehensive understanding of how each cell of complex eukaryotes uses the epigenome to determine the critical roles it plays in development of disease states. This can be achieved through the integration of molecular biology, bioinformatics, population genetic and evolutionary concepts. During my first postdoctoral fellowship, at the Cancer Research Center of Laval University,
