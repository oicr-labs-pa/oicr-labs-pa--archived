  Before joining the Awadalla lab at the University of Toronto as a PhD student in 2015 I was awarded a BSc and a MSc in bioinformatics from the University of Montreal. In the context of my MSc, I created methods to analyze the allelic variation of polymorphic repetitive genes from Next-Generation Sequencing data. I am broadly interested in the integration of heterogeneous sources of biological data. The goal of my dissertation is to further understand the expression of meiosis specific genes, especially those involved in recombination processes. I aim to investigate how these genes influence the genomic landscape across different cancer types.
