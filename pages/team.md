subtitle_txt: "Dr. Philip Awadalla, Principal Investigator"
main_txt: "Dr. Philip Awadalla, PhD, is Director of Computational Biology and Senior Investigator at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Professor of Population and Medical Genomics at the University of Toronto and is a Director and Principal Investigator of the Ontario Health Study/Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project. He is also the Director of the Genome Canada Canadian Data Integration Centre. Dr. Awadalla was trained at the University of Edinburgh and his team focuses on the development of next-generation genomics approaches, model-based tools and population-based approaches to study mutation rates, genome biology and cancer. His team’s research also focuses on systems and population genomics approaches to capture signals in population-based samples or families as well as tools to capture rare or de novo variants and pathways, potentially critical to disease phenotypes. Dr. Awadalla’s main research interests include identifying genomic determinants of blood disorders and cancers, understanding mutation and recombination biology and genomic epidemiology of age-related disorders in population cohorts."
