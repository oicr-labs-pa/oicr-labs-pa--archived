  title_txt: "About Us"
  description_txt: |
    The Awadalla Lab, headed by Philip Awadalla, is jointly housed at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/) and the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). Working with genomic data, and through the development of computational tools, the laboratory interrogates genomic and environmental contributions associated with the frequency and severity of diseases in human populations.
