  topDescription_txt: "Philip Awadalla has trained and continues to train 14 graduate students and PDFs and many of his former students have gone on to become university faculty and postdoctoral fellows. Our preference is to take on Ph.D. students but we are also willing to supervise M.Sc. students."

graduates:
  title_txt: "Graduate and Postdoctoral Training"
  leftDescription_txt: |
    Students with a background in **genomics, statistical genetics and evolutionary biology** having an interest in **medical genomics, population genetics, and genomics of infectious disease** are especially welcome. Students with strengths in other areas such as computational and statistical biology will also be considered.

  right_txt: "What to expect:"
  right_list:
    - |
      A range of potential topics are provided, usually 2-4 general problems are discussed. We are also happy to entertain projects that the student might suggest, so long as they are sufficiently innovative.
    - |
      Academic and logistical support is provided to conduct the research throughout the duration of the program.
    - |
      Once research questions are formulated, the student/fellow is encouraged to develop new avenues and questions related to the problem.
    - |
      Research scientists in the laboratory normally are expected to publish 4-6 journal articles from their time in the lab. This enables them to be in a better position to obtain post-doctoral or academic positions.

undergrads:
  title_txt: "Bioinformatics, Undergraduate and Volunteer Opportunities"
  left_txt: |
    We also hire **bioinformaticians** and **undergraduates** to assist with research projects being conducted in the lab.


    Additionally, we are interested in conscientious **volunteers** and if performance is satisfactory this can lead to being hired as a paid assistant during the summer months.
