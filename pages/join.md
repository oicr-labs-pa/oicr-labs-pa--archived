subtitle_txt: "Philip Awadalla has trained and continues to train 14 graduate students and PDFs, and many of his former students have gone on to become university faculty and postdoctoral fellows. Our preference is to take on Ph.D. students but we are also willing to supervise M.Sc. students."

    leftContent_txt: |
      A Postdoctoral position is available in the population and medical genomics laboratory of Philip Awadalla in Toronto at the University of Toronto and Ontario Institute for Cancer Research. The lab focuses on analysis, development of methods and sequencing experiments studying the evolutionary genomics of aging processes (including mutation and recombination), disease and cancer evolution using data from large longitudinal population cohorts that we oversee (e.g. <a href="https://portal.partnershipfortomorrow.ca">Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project</a>). 

      Our lab also works in close collaboration with a number of research laboratories in Toronto and internationally, including new programs within the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research and Princess Margaret Hospital, and projects related to dementia and aging-related neurological processes. Our Genome Canada platform for genomics and bioinformatics (the <a href="http://genome-cdic.ca">Genome Canada Canadian Data Integration Centre</a>) supports much of our initiatives. 

      The successful candidate will be nearing the completion/having a PhD or equivalent postdoctoral training in genomics or population/ statistical genetics. Postdoctoral research scientists can work on projects of their choosing related to the labs current projects. Some recent publications from the lab are listed below.
